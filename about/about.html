        <h1>What is Willo?</h1>
        <p>
            Willo is a virtual concert series that focuses on mindfulness. 
            Mindfulness is the practice of being in the present moment, without judgment, 
            by fully accepting one's thoughts and feelings. Music can be used to reach a state of 
            mindfulness by concentrating on the beat and rhythm in order to stay present. Willo intends 
            to offer a space to practice mindfulness through music and discuss how to engage with the uncertainty 
            of the world around us.

        <h2>The Story </h2>
        <p>
            My father passed away suddenly six months ago. It was devastating and I felt completely lost. 
            It didn’t matter who I was with or where I was, but I couldn't focus on anything else. 
            When I was in the hospital comforting my father in his final days, music was the only thing that allowed 
            me to find clarity. It made me confident that I could handle this. After my father’s passing, I wanted to understand: 
            What is it about music that makes it so healing? 
            I started to dig into the research. I discovered that what music is offering is mindfulness, a practice in which one 
            consciously brings their thoughts into the present moment. Mindfulness can help humans cope with everything from 
            unimaginable tragedy down to day-to-day stresses, I wanted to create a space where people could develop this skill and 
            apply it towards their own lives.

        <h2>The Shows </h2>
        <p>
            In a world of constant pressure and difficulty, music and mindfulness can be a tool to help process the overwhelming 
            feelings and uncertainty of life. Our series will focus not only on the practice of mindfulness through music, but also 
            on discussion around how musicians practice mindfulness with their art. Each show lasts approximately 45 minutes. They
             are introduced by our host, Crystal Desai, followed by a performance from our featured musician and concluded 
             with a conversation to share reflections between host, performer and audience.
