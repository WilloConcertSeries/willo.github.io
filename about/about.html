                Willo is a virtual concert series that focuses on mindfulness. 
                Mindfulness is the practice of being in the present moment, without judgment, 
                by fully accepting one's thoughts and feelings. Music can be used to reach a state of 
                mindfulness by concentrating on the beat and rhythm in order to stay present. Willo intends 
                to offer a space to practice mindfulness through music and discuss how to engage with the uncertainty 
                of the world around us.

            <h2>The Story </h2>
            <p>
                My father passed away suddenly six months ago. It was devastating and I felt completely lost. 
                It didn’t matter who I was with or where I was, but I couldn't focus on anything else. 
                When I was in the hospital comforting my father in his final days, music was the only thing that allowed 
                me to find clarity. It made me confident that I could handle this. After my father’s passing, I wanted to understand: 
                What is it about music that makes it so healing? 
                I started to dig into the research. I discovered that what music is offering is mindfulness, a practice in which one 
                consciously brings their thoughts into the present moment. Mindfulness can help humans cope with everything from 
                unimaginable tragedy down to day-to-day stresses, I wanted to create a space where people could develop this skill and 
                apply it towards their own lives.

                In a world of constant pressure and difficulty, music and mindfulness can be a tool to help process the overwhelming 
                feelings and uncertainty of life. Our series will focus not only on the practice of mindfulness through music, but also 
                on discussion around how musicians practice mindfulness with their art. Willow concerts run approximately 45 minutes, with the following format:
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Intro</h3> Our host Crystal touches on the series' mission statement, gives an overview of the program, introduces the artist, and explains the mindfulness activity that will coincide with the performance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Performance</h3>  (runtimes are roughly correspond to a 4-5 song setlist)
                    </li>
                    <li> <h3>Conversation</h3>
                        Hosts, musicians, and audience reflect on the emotions and sensations experienced during the performance and the concurrent mindfulness activity. (Headphone and microphone use is encouraged)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Outro</h3> Crystal gives a few final details about the performer (where to find their work / follow and support them) before sending us off. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
